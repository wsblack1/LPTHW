This is my repository for working through Zed Shaw's book "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way"

Comment after the first 39 exercises:
I have enjoyed going through this book so far. I like that fact that you just jump in and start 
coding by copying what he's doing, learning what each thing is supposed do to, and then breaking it.
I already had *some* Python experience so some of the lessons are tedious (although they're designed to be in a way),
but I still believe all of them helped me get better. If you learn by doing like me, then you'll like this book.
